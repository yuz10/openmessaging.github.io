  WeBank and DataPipeline Join OpenMessaging to Build an Open Standard for Distributed Messaging.
---

We are excited to announce two new members to the OpenMessaging Project: WeBank,  China’s first privately-owned bank and the first digital-only bank that focuses on microloan borrowers, and DataPipeline, a company that focuses on helping organizations increase data mobility by connecting data, application and device. WeBank and DataPipeline join Alibaba, Streamlio, Didi and Yahoo! in creating a vendor-neutral and open standard for distributed messaging that can be deployed in the cloud, on-premise, and with hybrid use cases.

The acceleration of microservice-based and cloud-based applications has put a growing focus on how data is connected to services, applications and users. This focus has led to a number of new innovations and new products that support messaging and queueing needs. It has also contributed to increased demands on messaging and queuing solutions, making performance and scalability critical to success.

The OpenMessaging community looks to eliminate these challenges through:

-Creating a global, cloud-oriented, vendor-neutral industry standard for distributed messaging     
-Facilitating a standard benchmark for testing applications     
-Enabling platform independence     
-Targeting cloud data streaming and messaging requirements with scalability, flexibility, isolation, and security built-in     
-Fostering a growing community of contributing developers      

Headquartered in Shenzhen, China, WeBank is China’s first privately-owned bank and first digital-only bank focusing on microloan borrowers and initiated by Linux Foundation Platinum member, Tencent. The company uses different banking architectures, from distributed architecture to open source technologies, and fully utilizes the benefits of messaging by implementing various messaging techniques in different scenarios, such as message exchanges, pub/sub and request/reply models.

“We’ve built a messaging bus called WeMQ, which is also compatible with other messaging services. These are critical to our business. However, after adding different messaging services, we realized there is a need for a universal, scalable and reliable standard for distributed messaging, in order for us to scale,” said Eason Chen, WeBank Tech Specialist. “We believe OpenMessaging can address our current challenges, and we look forward to contributing to its efforts.”

As a next-generation integration PaaS technology provider, DataPipeline serves many Fortune 500 customers from financial, retail and manufacture sectors, solving the problem of integrating thousands of data sources and billions of messages in real time with zero effort.

The team at DataPipeline has experience in building large scale data mobility applications based on open source MQs. When the microservice framework started to gain traction, doing high concurrency service calls, bulk data streaming and joining became huge problems.

“As we started to adopt a variety of open source MQ solutions (Apache RocketMQ, Apache Kafka, etc.), we began to notice that these solutions were not cloud native and language agnostics, creating major problems for those that are looking to implement digital transformation,” said Cheng Chen, CEO of DataPipeline. “The industry needs a standard to unify the abstraction of messaging systems. We look forward to collaborating with the OpenMessaging project to create an open standard for distributed messaging systems that will not be impacted by the underlying MQ implementation.”
