Today, the OpenMessaging Project — a collaborative project focused on creating a vendor-neutral open standard for distributed messaging — announced four new members JD.com, China Mobile Cloud, QingCloud, and Whale Cloud. Current members include Alibaba, DataPipeline, Di Di, Streamlio, WeBank, and Yahoo!.

The acceleration of microservice-based and cloud-based applications has put a growing focus on how data is connected to services, applications, and users. This focus has led to a number of new innovations and new products that support messaging and queueing needs. It has also contributed to increased demands on messaging and queuing solutions, making performance and scalability critical to success, and the need for an open standardization a must.

The goal of the OpenMessaging Project is to build out an industry standard, cloud oriented, and vendor neutral open standard for distributed messaging. More on this project and how to participate here: http://openmessaging.cloud

“At China Mobile and CMsoft, we have built a MQ proxy system of Apache RocketMQ  to provide a set of producer APIs and consumer APIs. The redundancy of having to hide the differences among the MQs takes so much time and energy out of our team. Given our knowledge in this field, we understand first hand the importance of a messaging communication standard. Having a vendor-neutral and language-independent MQ standard guideline is a big win for many applications. We believe this standard can help and promote the MQ technology that we rely on.” – Henry Hu, Architect at China Mobile and CMsoft.

“As a cloud provider, we offer various messaging services including Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and RocketMQ to our customers. More and more people keep asking us what software to use for their messaging requirements as the market is saturated with various open source solutions. This market saturation causes not only a high learning curve, but also a high maintenance cost. An industry open standard, vendor-neutral and language-independent specification for distributed messaging is increasingly important, especially in a cloud era. We look forward to collaborating with the OpenMessaging project to help drive messaging service towards a unified, open standard interface.” – Ray Zhou, Development Director at QingCloud

“At the JD Group, JingDong Message Queue (JMQ) has been widely used. However, despite our efforts to be compatible with all kinds of message protocols, we still can’t meet all the requirements. We are planning to open source JMQ, so it can be implemented for OpenMessaging. We see OpenMessaging as a de-facto international open standard for distributed messaging that aims at satisfying the need of modern cloud-native messaging and streaming applications. We sincerely believe that a unified and widely-accepted messaging standard can benefit MQ technology and applications relied on it.” – DeQiang Lin, Messaging Leader at the JingDong Middleware Department

“Currently, message queuing uses proprietary, closed protocols, restricting the ability for different operating systems or programming languages to interact in a heterogeneous set of environments. At Whale Cloud, in order to make it easy for developers to use messaging and streaming services, we’ve worked to eliminate the differences between the different protocols. Giving us insight and knowledge to know that a vendor-neutral and language-independent open specification is badly needed.” – Zheng Tao, Technical Director of Distributed Messaging and Streaming Data Platform at Whale Cloud
